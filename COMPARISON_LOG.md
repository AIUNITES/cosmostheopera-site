## CHANGES MADE (January 20, 2026)

### 1. Scene 2 "My Twin" - REWRITTEN ✅

**Previous SSAATTBB text (WRONG):**
```
somewhere across the galaxies there is another me
a twin star burning bright separated by endless night...
```

**Corrected SSAATTBB text (NOW MATCHES SATB):**
```
when i am near you i feel that way again
like i found my best friend
like i am holding myself
like i am holding my twin
just the touch of you
you move me in so many ways
how would it be if we were to gaze together
as we orbit in our galaxy and throb to the waves
for a time or for an eternity
are you my twin burning together in some galaxy
were we once two bright suns roaming the galaxy
together orbiting each other
only to be trapped on this planet for this short time
```

**8-Part Structure Preserved:**
- Waltz section (3/4) with canon between voice sections
- Wave motif from Act II incorporated
- Full SSAATTBB voicing throughout

---

### 2. Scene 3 "Feeling Again" - REWRITTEN ✅

**Previous SSAATTBB text (WRONG):**
```
i am feeling again i am living again
the universe is singing and i am singing too...
```

**Corrected SSAATTBB text (NOW MATCHES SATB):**
```
you make me feel that feeling again
like i am holding my best friend
and like you could be here to the end
you make me feel like it can be real
if i could only hold you night and day
and through space and time
as we travel to some other place
if i could be there with you now
to feel you to hold you to love you
i would make the world go away
i would make the rain stay in the sky
i would turn the dark days to light
i would be there for you
and show you what love can do
```

**Supreme Climax Preserved:**
- Tenor E7 maintained
- Soprano A7 maintained
- 12-beat fermata on peak
- Full SSAATTBB maximum voicing (S1: A7, S2: E7, etc.)

---

### 3. Scene 4 "You're A Star" - REWRITTEN ✅

**Previous SSAATTBB text:**
```
you're a star you shine so bright
you light the night you guide our sight...
```

**Corrected SSAATTBB text (NOW MATCHES SATB):**
```
you're a star everybody loves you
the first time they see you
your smile you're beautiful all the way through
what you've been through
a heart of gold eyes so full of love for everyone
reach out for the stars show them the love you have
they love you so much
just touch the stars and show them your heart
a heart full of gold that's what the universe told
```
