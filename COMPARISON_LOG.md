a mirror in a face that hangs here
looking for you
```

### ACT II: INTO ✅ ALL MATCHING

#### Scene 1: "The Colors"

in so many ways in so many shades

```

**Sheet Music:** ✅ Both versions have complete notation including coloratura

#### Scene 2: "The Waves"
**SATB Prose:**

feel all of it feel everything
the waves through it all the waves in it all
the waves of the creation
the waves of the creator
the waves that are you
everything is one
everything is a wave all is the same
we are all the same (3x, diminuendo to niente)
```
**SSAATTBB:** ✅ Has same prose, 8-part wave ostinato
**Sheet Music:** ✅ Both versions have complete notation

---

### ACT III: BEINGS ⚠️ DISCREPANCIES

#### Scene 1: "I the Sun" ✅ MATCHING
**SATB Prose:**
```
did you say that i could be the sun to you
so warm and so bright
one truth in your life
and then yet so far from you
how could i be the sun to you when you are the sun to me
so warm and so infinite and so bright
if we could only see the sun as one
but we can only see as two
i am so far from you
```
**SSAATTBB:** ✅ Has same prose, Soprano+Tenor duet structure preserved
**Sheet Music:** ✅ Both versions have complete notation

---

#### Scene 2: "My Twin" 🔴 DIFFERENT PROSE

**SATB Complete Score Text (Appendix A):**
```
when i am near you i feel that way again
like i found my best friend
like i am holding myself
like i am holding my twin
just the touch of you
you move me in so many ways
how would it be if we were to gaze together
as we orbit in our galaxy and throb to the waves
for a time or for an eternity
are you my twin burning together in some galaxy
in some other time
were we once two bright suns roaming the galaxy
together orbiting each other
as we moved through space
only to be trapped on this planet for this short time
```

**SSAATTBB ACT3 Text:**
```
somewhere across the galaxies there is another me
a twin star burning bright separated by endless night
do you feel what i feel do you see what i see
i send my light across the void hoping it reaches you
my twin, my mirror, my other self
somewhere you are looking back at me
and someday our light will meet somewhere between the stars
until then, i shine for you
```

**Analysis:** 
- 🔴 The SSAATTBB version has COMPLETELY DIFFERENT prose
- SATB version is about finding a twin/best friend (intimate)
- SSAATTBB version is about a distant twin star (cosmic/Observer solo)
- **SSAATTBB needs to be updated to match SATB libretto**

**Sheet Music Status:**
- SATB: ✅ Has notation for SATB prose (Soprano+Tenor duet)
- SSAATTBB: ✅ Has notation but for different text (Observer solo)

---

#### Scene 3: "Feeling Again" 🔴 DIFFERENT PROSE

**SATB Complete Score Text (Appendix A):**
```
you make me feel that feeling again
like i am holding my best friend
and like you could be here to the end
you make me feel like it can be real
if i could only hold you night and day
and through space and time
as we travel to some other place
if i could be there with you now
to feel you to hold you to love you
i would make the world go away
i would make the rain stay in the sky
i would turn the dark days to light
i would be there for you
and show you what love can do
```

**SSAATTBB ACT3 Text:**
```
i am feeling again i am living again
the universe is singing and i am singing too
every atom every star we are what we are
feel the light feel the love feel the warmth feel alive
WE ARE ALIVE
```

**Analysis:**
- 🔴 The SSAATTBB version has DIFFERENT prose and context
- SATB version is an intimate duet about love ("you make me feel")
- SSAATTBB version is a joyful chorus celebration ("i am feeling again")
- The emotional focus is completely different
- **SSAATTBB needs to be updated to match SATB libretto**

**Sheet Music Status:**
- SATB: ✅ Has notation including Tenor E7 and Soprano A7 climax
- SSAATTBB: ✅ Has notation but for different text (chorus celebration)

---

#### Scene 4: "You're A Star" 🟡 SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT STRUCTURE

**SATB Complete Score Text (Appendix A):**
```
you're a star everybody loves you
the first time they see you
your smile you're beautiful all the way through
what you've been through
a heart of gold eyes so full of love for everyone
reach out for the stars show them the love you have
they love you so much
just touch the stars and show them your heart
a heart full of gold that's what the universe told
```

**SSAATTBB ACT3 Text:**
```
you're a star you shine so bright
you light the night you guide our sight
you are the light
go now and shine let your light combine with all the stars divine
the star within you the star within me
the star within all eternally
```

**Analysis:**
- 🟡 Similar theme but different specific lines
- Both are "dismissal/benediction" scenes
- SATB focuses on "heart of gold" / beauty
- SSAATTBB focuses on "shine/light" imagery
- Could be considered different arrangements of same concept

**Sheet Music Status:**
- SATB: ✅ Has notation
- SSAATTBB: ✅ Has notation for its version

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Fix Missing Finale 🔴
- Create `COSMOS-SSAATTBB-ACT3.md` section for "The Eternal Return"
- Include 8-part voicing for all three climactic sections
- This is the most critical missing element

### Priority 2: Align Act III Scene 2 "My Twin" 🔴
- Rewrite SSAATTBB version to match SATB libretto
- Maintain 8-part structure but use correct prose:
  - "when i am near you i feel that way again..."
  - Include waltz section "were we once two bright suns"

### Priority 3: Align Act III Scene 3 "Feeling Again" 🔴
- Rewrite SSAATTBB version to match SATB libretto
- This is the SUPREME CLIMAX - must preserve:
  - "you make me feel that feeling again"
  - Tenor E7 and Soprano A7 climax notes
  - "i would make the world go away" build

### Priority 4: Review Act III Scene 4 "You're A Star" 🟡
- Consider if SSAATTBB version is an acceptable variation
- Or align to match SATB "heart of gold" prose

---

## CONCLUSION

**Acts I & II:** ✅ Fully aligned, all prose lines have sheet music in both versions

**Act III:** ⚠️ Significant discrepancies
- Scenes 2-3 have completely different text
- Finale is missing from SSAATTBB
- Scene 4 has thematic variations

**Action Required:** Update SSAATTBB Act III to match the canonical SATB libretto
