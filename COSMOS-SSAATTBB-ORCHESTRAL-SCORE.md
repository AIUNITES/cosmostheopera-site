# ORCHESTRATION PRINCIPLES

## Texture Guidelines

### Cosmic Stillness (pp-p)
- Strings: Sul tasto, harmonics, divisi
- Winds: Solo instruments, sustained
- Synthesizer: Ambient pads
- Harps: Harmonics, gentle arpeggios

### Building Energy (mp-mf)
- Strings: Normal bowing, building layers
- Winds: Section doublings
- Brass: Horns sustain, muted trumpets
- Percussion: Soft rolls, vibraphone

### Full Power (f-fff)
- Full orchestra tutti
- Brass: Open, brilliant
- Percussion: Timpani, bass drum, tam-tam
- Strings: Full bow, tremolo for intensity

### Choral Balance with Orchestra
- 8-part chorus requires careful orchestral balance
- Reduce orchestra during exposed choral passages
- Double choral lines with winds for support
- Use strings for harmonic foundation
