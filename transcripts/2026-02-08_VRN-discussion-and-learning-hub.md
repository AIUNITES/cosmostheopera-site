# VRN Discussion: Origin & Target Audience

## Why Has No One Created a VRN Before?

Several converging factors explain why no formalized vocal resonance notation existed before COSMOS:

1. **Vocal pedagogy is built on metaphor, not measurement.** For centuries, voice teachers used subjective imagery ("sing into the mask," "place it forward"). These metaphors work in 1-on-1 lessons but are impossible to standardize. The tradition actively resists formalization.

2. **Existing notation evolved for pitch and rhythm, not production.** Western notation (from 9th century neumes → staff notation) specifies *what* to sing but not *how* to produce it. IPA covers phonetics (vowel/consonant shapes) but nothing about resonance placement. The gap between "what sound" and "how your body makes it" was simply left blank.

3. **The knowledge is embodied, not intellectual.** Resonance placement is proprioceptive — you feel it in bones. The community consensus was that it *couldn't* be encoded in text.

4. **It sits between disciplines that don't talk to each other.** Acoustics researchers study formants/spectrograms. Voice teachers use metaphor. Composers write notes. Music theorists analyze harmony. VRN requires someone who understands vocal production *physically*, music notation *structurally*, and has systems-thinking to design a symbolic language. Very unusual intersection.

5. **No commercial pressure to solve it.** No industry demanded this. Opera houses don't commission notation systems. Voice science journals publish spectrograms, not performance notation.

**Key comparison:** VRN does for vocal production what IPA did for phonetics. IPA = mouth shape. VRN = where the body resonates and how intensely.

## Who Needs VRN the Most?

### Tier 1: Most Urgent Need

1. **Voice Teachers** — Every lesson is currently ephemeral. Teacher says "more head voice, less push" and the correction evaporates when the student leaves. VRN gives them written prescriptions: "measure 14, shift from [C++, H+] to [H++, N++, P+]." Students take it home and practice the *production*, not just the notes. Transforms voice teaching from oral tradition into documented methodology.

2. **Choral Directors** — Managing 40+ singers who all interpret "darker tone" differently. With VRN: altos at [C++, P++, O+] for this passage, sopranos at [H+++, N++] for the climax. Everyone works from the same physical target instead of guessing conductor's gestures.

### Tier 2: High Need

3. **Vocal Rehabilitation Specialists** — Speech-language pathologists working with damaged voices, post-surgery patients, singers recovering from nodules. Need precise documentation of what the voice *was* doing vs what it *should* do. VRN = treatment plans and progress tracking far more specific than "patient reports improved resonance."

4. **Remote/Online Voice Students** — The pandemic exposed how much voice pedagogy depends on being in the same room. VRN bridges the gap — a teacher in Milan can annotate a score for a student in Oklahoma with exact resonance targets, not vague emails.

### Tier 3: Significant Benefit

5. **Composers Writing for Voice** — VRN lets composers specify timbral intent, not just pitch. Demonstrated in COSMOS — annotations tell performers exactly what vocal color is intended. Current state: composers write "con forza" or "dolce" and hope for the best.

6. **Voice Science Researchers** — Need a bridge between spectrograms and actual pedagogy. Can measure formants all day but have no standardized way to communicate findings to working singers. VRN = shared language between the lab and the studio.
