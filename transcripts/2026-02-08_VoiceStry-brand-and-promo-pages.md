---

## Promotional Pages Created

### vocal-gearshift.html — "Your Voice Has 5 Gears. You've Been Stuck in 2nd."
- Maps vocal registers to manual transmission gears (1-5)
- Each gear has color-coded card with VRN recipe, description, and "Feel it" exercise
- 4 gear shift (passaggio) cards explaining each transition with VRN notation
- José Simerilla Romero quote on 5-octave technique as manual transmission
- Before/After comparison (Without Map vs With VRN Gear Map)
- CTAs to VRN practice, notation reference, and pitch trainer
- Red→orange gradient theme

### vocal-bodybuilding.html — "Bodybuilding for the Voice"
- Maps 6 VRN resonance zones to gym muscle groups:
  - Chest [C] = Pecs (power base)
  - Head [H] = Shoulders/Traps (projection frame)
  - Nasal [N] = Core (connector)
  - Oral [O] = Arms (shapeable)
  - Pharyngeal [P] = Back (deep, invisible, essential)
  - Low Body [L] = Legs (foundation everyone skips)
- 10-row gym-to-voice translation comparison table
- Sample 3-Day Voice Split with VRN-annotated exercises:
  - Day 1: Chest & Low Body Day (Power & Foundation)
  - Day 2: Head & Mask Day (Brilliance & Projection)
  - Day 3: Compound Day — Full Voice (Blending All Zones)
- Mind-muscle connection section
- Green→cyan gradient theme
- Cross-links to gear shift page and VRN practice

### notation.html Updates
- Added second row of hero buttons:
  - 🔄 5 Gears of Your Voice (red→orange gradient)
  - 💪 Bodybuilding for the Voice (green→cyan gradient)

## Peter Barber Response Analysis

### His Reply (LinkedIn, Dec 24, 2025)
Peter Barber responded to Tom's VRN outreach post. Key points:
- Called it "a very interesting tool"
- Said it "can certainly be used to assist in targeting more resonance"
- Warned it "can also be misleading because there are better/more efficient ways to increase resonance, and there are ways to force your way there"
- Said "using the software in conjunction with an expert voice teacher to keep the technique locked in is critical"
- Signed off as "Tom Hines, ERP Consultant" (likely auto-signature)
- Linked his company: linkedin.com/company/harmonyhomony

### Analysis
- **He called it "software"** — strong indicator he never visited the actual pages
- He read the LinkedIn post, mentally categorized VRN as vocal analysis app (like Singscope/VoceVista), and responded to that imagined product
- His concern about "forcing your way there" is valid for biofeedback software but doesn't apply to written notation
- His response actually confirms VRN's positioning need: "notation" as a word doesn't register with most people — they hear "vocal technology" and think app
- "System" or "framework" might land better than "notation" in outreach to voice professionals who aren't composers
- His company "harmonyhomony" has no web presence — no search results, possibly very early stage

### harmonyhomony.com Assessment
- No web presence, no search results
- LinkedIn company page exists but minimal
- Name is confusing (Harmony + homony? typo?)
- Hard to spell from memory
- Already associated with Peter's project
- Not recommended for VRN branding

## Domain Naming Strategy Discussion

### Names Evaluated and Rejected

**Too clinical/anatomical (throat stigma):**
- ThyroLaryn, CricoThyroid Notations, MusculoVocal, Laryngeal Harmony
- These lean INTO the discomfort instead of abstracting away from it

**Too generic/crowded:**
- Acoustic Insights, Vocal Dynamics, The Sound Stage, Vocal Signature

**Too metaphorical/vague:**
- The Singer's Palette, Sonic Canvas, The Vocal Bridge

**Decent but not great:**
- Voice Blueprint, The Singer's Map, Vocal Compass
- VoiceChart (short, clear, but might be taken)
- Vocal Architect (strong but long)
- NotePoint (clean but confusable with presentation apps)

### Key Insight: "Resonance" and "Notation" Too Clinical
- Independent musicians hear "notation" and think sheet music they can't read
- "Resonance" signals physics class
- "Method" sounds like something you can learn
- "-Stry" sounds like something you can do

### Domains Acquired

**vrnmethod.com**
- Professional/educational entry point
- Voice teachers, choral directors, SLPs
- "Method" slots into existing mental category (Suzuki Method, Mel Bay Method, Faber Method)
- Professionals comfortable with acronyms (IPA, SOVT, SLP)

**voicestry.com**
- Consumer/creator entry point
- YouTube viewers, indie singers, podcasters, church choir singers
- No jargon — sounds like a place to work on your voice
- Double reading: "VoiceStry" (craft/foundry) + "VoicesTry" (invitation to try)
- Matches AIUNITES naming pattern (BizStry)
- Where "5 Gears" and "Bodybuilding for Your Voice" content lives

### Two-Door Strategy
- VoiceStry for discovery (consumers, creators, YouTube audience)
- VRN Method for depth (professionals, educators, researchers)
- Both lead to same system, cross-linked
- YouTube vocal coach crowd finds VoiceStry
- Voice teacher looking for framework finds VRN Method

## VoiceStry Site Plan (New AIUNITES Site #19)

### Migration from COSMOS
Move these pages from cosmostheopera-site to voicestry-site:
- notation.html → VRN reference page (rebrand as "The VRN Method")
- vrn-practice.html → Learning hub (8 progressive VRN lessons)
- pitch-trainer.html → Pitch training tool
- sight-reading.html → Sight reading tool
- vocal-gearshift.html → "5 Gears of Your Voice" promo
- vocal-bodybuilding.html → "Bodybuilding for the Voice" promo

### New Content Planned
- VRN Method overview page (what is VRN, why it exists, who it's for)
- Vocal games (gamification of VRN learning)
- Landing/home page with the key hooks:
  - "Your Voice Has 5 Gears"
  - "Bodybuilding for Your Voice"
  - "Learn to Sing 5 Octaves"

### COSMOS Retains
- Opera content, story, libretto
- Sheet music with VRN annotations (links to VoiceStry for VRN reference)
- Music player, composer tool
- Hubble gallery, meditation, words pages

### Architecture Decision
- VoiceStry = the brand/site/platform
- VRN = the notation system/method (lives within VoiceStry)
- Like GitHub (platform) vs Git (technology)
- Tagline: "VoiceStry: Home of Vocal Resonance Notation"

## Key Strategic Quotes from Session

On Peter Barber's response:
> "He read your LinkedIn post, saw 'Vocal Resonance Notation,' mentally categorized it as some kind of vocal analysis app, and responded to that imagined product."

On why "notation" doesn't land:
> "'Notation' as a word doesn't register with most people. They hear 'vocal technology' and think app. The word 'notation' is invisible to anyone outside music theory."

On the two-domain strategy:
> "VoiceStry for discovery, VRN Method for depth. Same content ecosystem, two doors in."

On VoiceStry name:
> "The double reading is actually great marketing. It's literally what you're inviting people to do. 'Voices try.' Try the 5 gears. Try the resonance zones. Try VRN."
